        <p>
          Sexual and reproductive health encompasses the physical, mental, and
          social well-being related to all aspects of the reproductive system.
          It addresses the reproductive processes, functions, and systems at all
          stages of life.
        </p>
        <p>Good sexual and reproductive health means:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Having accurate information about your body</li>
          <li>Access to safe, effective, and affordable contraception</li>

            <h4 class="card-title">What is the Menstrual Cycle?</h4>
            <p>
              The menstrual cycle is a series of natural changes in hormone
              production and the structures of the uterus and ovaries that make
              pregnancy possible. The average cycle length is 28 days, but it
              can range from 21 to 35 days.
            </p>
            <p>
              The cycle is regulated by hormones from the brain
              (follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone) and the
              ovaries (estrogen and progesterone).
            </p>
            <p>Understanding your menstrual cycle helps you:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Predict when your period will occur</li>
              <li>Identify your fertile window if trying to conceive</li>
              <li>Recognize when something might be abnormal</li>
              <li>Better understand your body's patterns and changes</li>

            <p>
              Healthy sexual relationships are built on clear consent and open

            <ul>
              <li>
                Freely given - without pressure, manipulation, or under the

              <li>Reversible - can be withdrawn at any time</li>
              <li>Informed - all parties understand what's involved</li>
              <li>Enthusiastic - all parties genuinely want to participate</li>
              <li>

            If your periods are consistently irregular (cycles shorter than 21
            days or longer than 35 days, or varying significantly), it's worth
            discussing with your healthcare provider. While some variation is
            normal, persistent irregularity may indicate underlying conditions
            like polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), thyroid disorders, or
            hormonal imbalances. In the meantime, tracking your periods using
            our menstrual cycle tracker can help identify patterns and provide
            valuable information for your healthcare provider. Lifestyle factors
            like extreme stress, significant weight changes, or excessive
            exercise can also affect your cycle, so addressing these may help.

          <div class="accordion-body">
            Normal vaginal discharge varies in consistency and amount throughout
            your menstrual cycle due to hormonal changes. Healthy discharge is
            usually clear to white, may be stretchy, creamy, or watery, and has
            a mild or no odor. It typically increases around ovulation and
            before your period. Signs that may indicate an infection include:
            <ul>
              <li>Change in color (yellow, green, gray)</li>
              <li>Cottage cheese-like texture</li>
              <li>Strong or foul odor</li>
              <li>Accompanied by itching, burning, pain, or redness</li>
              <li>Significant increase in amount</li>
            </ul>

            If you notice these changes, especially if accompanied by
            discomfort, consult with a healthcare provider. Many vaginal
            infections are easily treatable with medication.

            Current guidelines recommend:
            <ul>
              <li>Ages 21-29: Pap smear every 3 years</li>
              <li>
                Ages 30-65: Pap smear and HPV co-testing every 5 years
                (preferred) OR Pap smear alone every 3 years
              </li>
              <li>
                After 65: Can stop screening if you've had adequate prior
                screening with normal results
              </li>
            </ul>

            However, these are general guidelines. Your healthcare provider may
            recommend a different schedule based on your risk factors, such as:
            <ul>
              <li>History of abnormal Pap results</li>
              <li>HIV infection</li>
              <li>Weakened immune system</li>
              <li>Exposure to DES (diethylstilbestrol) before birth</li>
              <li>History of cervical cancer</li>
            </ul>

            Even if you don't need annual Pap smears, regular gynecological
            exams are still important for overall reproductive health.

            Many women experience some discomfort during menstruation, but
            severe pain that interferes with daily activities isn't normal and
            may indicate conditions like endometriosis, fibroids, or
            adenomyosis. Here are strategies to manage period pain:

            <h5 class="mt-3">Home remedies:</h5>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen
                (start taking before pain becomes severe)
              </li>
              <li>Heat therapy (heating pad or warm bath)</li>
              <li>Gentle exercise like walking or yoga</li>
              <li>Relaxation techniques and adequate rest</li>
              <li>
                Avoiding alcohol, caffeine, and salty foods that can worsen
                bloating and discomfort
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h5 class="mt-3">
              Medical treatments your doctor might recommend:
            </h5>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Hormonal birth control methods to regulate periods and reduce
                pain
              </li>
              <li>Prescription-strength pain relievers</li>
              <li>Treatment for underlying conditions if present</li>
            </ul>

            If period pain is severe, gets worse over time, or doesn't respond
            to over-the-counter medicine, consult with a healthcare provider.
